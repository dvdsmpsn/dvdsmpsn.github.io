I saw this in a Slack channel, so wanted to preserve it before it vanishes forever.

## Question

> After switching to a M1 Mac, sometimes my atlas-debug doesnt get synchrony running and the Quick-Reload plugin is disabled, did anybody already seen this issue?

## Answers

- Make sure you are using the latest quickreload version (4.x)
- Synchrony is only supported on ARM from Confluence 7.18 onward: [CONFSERVER-78580](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-78580)

Remember, if you're using a free plan for Slack, your knowledge is never safe unless you save it elsewhere. It's like Snapchat for business.
